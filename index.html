<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Purple-striped jellies eat mainly zooplankton, fish eggs, larval fish, and sometimes other smaller jellies.  When prey touches their tentacles, they sting the prey to paralyze it, before eating it.  The sting of the purple-striped jelly is extremely painful to humans, but not fatal.</p>

<h4>Fun Facts</h4>
<ul><li>Some fish (like ocean sunfish) and turtles are immune to the sting of the jelly</li>
  <li>They have high concentrations of carbon and nitrogen in their arms</li>
  <li>Young cancer crabs are known to attach themselves to jellies and feed on parasites living on the jellies</li>
</ul>
